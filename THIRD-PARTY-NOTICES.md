Amanu itself is available under the [MIT license](LICENSE), retaining the
copyright and license notice of the quill project from which it began.

The LocalVQE build uses a small Amanu macOS packaging patch to produce one
self-contained Intel dylib instead of runtime-loaded CPU-variant libraries.
The inference implementation and model are otherwise the pinned upstream work.
